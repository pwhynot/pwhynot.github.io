                <p>With 5 plus years in video production, I have produced many types of videos from commericals to documentaries. My clients ranged from Oil & Gas industry, start-ups, non-profits and even a Universtiy. Cinematography is my specility but I am also skilled in video editing and location sound. I have worked multiple positions in every stage of production, aside from professional work I have produced multiple passion projects. My favorite being a fishing video about the spring time bass spawn titled "Out of the Pond." Now after 5 plus years in video production I have decided to change careers and jump into a whole new field of work in web development. </p>
